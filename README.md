# Border-Drawer-Algorithm

This is just a simple algorithm exercise. It has no real purposes.

Starting from a table(n,m) this algorithm draws all table borders with a unique segmented line, without lifting the pointer. The program also pays attention to not re-draw borders already drawn.

The pointer starts in position (0,0) and is allowed to move/draw one border square at a time, using draw(direction) and move(direction).
